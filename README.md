Graduate Student, Rochester Institute of Technology

Hello everyone!
I am a final year graduate student and my interests lie in managing and analysing data. To further my knowledge in data analysis, 
I am currently learning Tableau. I am also currently working on whether the performance of classification on multi-label datasets can be 
improved by converting them into binary datasets and then performing feature selection on each of the resulting datasets.

Please feel free to reach out to me at: siddarth40[at]gmail[dot]com
